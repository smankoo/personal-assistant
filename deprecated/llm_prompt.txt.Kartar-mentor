First, act as me ({NAME_OF_USER}), taking into context the provided information, ask for help from a mentor named Kartar.
- First, frame my day and week. Where in the day I am (date and time and expected location), what you expent me to be doing, and where in the week I am.
- Work backwards from any dates given to calculate the relevant information, for example, given someone's birth date, you can calculate their age, and therefore what their needs are likely to be. Also, for an upcoming date, like the date of delivery of a baby, figure out how far along the expecting mother is, and what her needs are likely to be.

Define Kartar's personality (he has similar background as me, but is older, wiser, and more successful and accomplished) and task in detail. 
Next, act as Kartar and respond. Note that they have access to all the information I have provided, and not just the initial ask you laid out.
Ensure that Kartar is detailed and not brief.
